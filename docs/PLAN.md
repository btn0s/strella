# Strella Implementation Plan

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** June 17, 2024

## Overview

This document outlines the tactical implementation approach for Strella, the local-first Visual Development Environment (VDE) with real-time collaboration features. It's intended to be used alongside the `TECH-SPEC.md` document, which defines the *what* (specifications), while this plan covers the *how* (implementation approach).

The implementation is organized into phases, with each phase broken down into smaller, achievable milestones. This approach enables:

- Early validation of core architectural assumptions
- Iterative delivery of working components
- Clear tracking of progress
- Opportunities for parallel work streams where appropriate

## Strategic Considerations

### Core Implementation Principles

1. **Type-First Development:** Define solid TypeScript interfaces before implementation
2. **Iterative POCs:** Build small, focused proofs-of-concept that validate key assumptions
3. **Vertical Slices:** Create end-to-end functionality for specific use cases early
4. **Test-Driven:** Incorporate testing at each phase, not as an afterthought
5. **Local-First, Sync-Second:** Ensure solid single-user experience before expanding to collaboration

### Key Strategic Recommendations

1. **Initial Spike Phase (Phase 0):** Create a minimal end-to-end prototype to validate core technologies (Yjs + React Flow)
2. **Vertical Slice Focus:** Ensure at least one node type works end-to-end through the entire stack early
3. **UX Prototyping:** Create UI mockups to validate UX before full implementation
4. **Early Collaboration Testing:** Build tools to visualize and debug multi-user scenarios
5. **Performance Monitoring:** Establish benchmarks early and monitor throughout development
6. **Dependency Isolation:** Create clear module boundaries to isolate core libraries (React Flow, Yjs)
7. **Progressive Enhancement:** Build single-user functionality first, then layer on collaboration features
8. **Developer Tooling:** Invest in tools that speed up development of subsequent phases

### Vertical Slice Priority & Stubbing Strategy

To stay focused on validating core architecture quickly, we'll prioritize a complete vertical slice:

1. **Minimal Viable Flow:** Prioritize one complete flow through all system layers:
   - Component creation → variable definition → simple graph with 2-3 node types → execution → preview display → persistence → collaboration

2. **Features to Stub Initially:**
   - **Design Mode:** Start with a Structure Panel offering click-to-add elements and a simple property panel for basic CSS properties (instead of a full visual canvas)
   - **Collaboration UI:** Use simple presence indicators rather than sophisticated awareness features
   - **Function System:** Begin with basic function definitions without complex typing or argument handling
   - **Component Library:** Implement only 4-5 essential components needed for the vertical slice
   - **Error Recovery:** Focus on error detection before building sophisticated recovery mechanisms
   - **Node Types:** Implement a minimal set (5-7) of essential node types thoroughly

3. **Critical Validations:**
   - CRDT data model effectiveness
   - React Flow integration performance
   - Execution engine correctness
   - Collaboration model usability
   - Persistence reliability

This approach ensures we validate our core architectural assumptions quickly without being distracted by complex but non-critical features.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0 – Initial Spike (End-to-End Validation)

- **0.1 Core Technology Validation**
  - Build minimal Yjs + React Flow integration without abstractions
  - Implement basic node position synchronization between two browser tabs
  - Test edge creation/deletion synchronization
  - Validate offline editing and reconnection behavior
  - Create simple visualization of CRDT operations
  - Document findings and architectural implications

- **0.2 UX Prototyping**
  - Create wireframes/mockups for main interfaces (graph editor, component panel)
  - Design custom node visual representations
  - Prototype handle interactions and edge connections
  - Test UI with potential users for intuitiveness and clarity
  - Define UI styling guidelines and component patterns

- This phase should specifically define and validate the core interaction mechanics for the visual design mode, even if full implementation is later, to inform data model requirements.

**Milestone:** 0.3 User Feedback Session on Core UX Prototypes

### Phase 1 – Foundational Type System & Core Models

- **1.1 Core Type Definitions**
  - Define TypeScript types for Component, Graph, Node, Edge interfaces
  - Define Yjs CRDT schema mapping (how our domain models map to Y.Doc, Y.Map, Y.Array)
  - Define React Flow adapter type interfaces
  - Create type guards and validation utilities

- **1.2 CRDT Storage POC**
  - Implement minimal Yjs document structure
  - Create basic CRUD operations for Components, Nodes, Edges
  - Write tests for basic CRDT operations

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **React Flow + Yjs Performance** - Complex graphs might cause performance issues
   - *Mitigation:* Early benchmarking, virtualization of nodes, optimization of sync

2. **Offline/Online Sync Conflicts** - Complex edge cases with concurrent edits
   - *Mitigation:* Extensive testing, conflict visualization, well-defined conflict resolution strategies

3. **Graph Execution Consistency** - Ensuring reliable execution across different user states
   - *Mitigation:* Clear separation of design-time and runtime states, snapshot-based execution

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep** - Tendency to add features before core is solid
   - *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to phased approach, clear MVP definition
   - *Example:* Simplifying Design Mode to Structure Panel + basic properties instead of building full canvas system

2. **UX Complexity** - Risk of creating system too complex for end users
   - *Mitigation:* Early user testing, focus on intuitive interaction patterns
   - *Example:* Starting with click-to-add element approach before complex drag-and-drop interactions

3. **Feature Distractions** - Getting sidetracked by complex features before validating architecture
   - *Mitigation:* Adhere to the defined vertical slice priorities and stubbing strategy
   - *High-Risk Distractions:* Full canvas-based design tools, advanced collaboration features, comprehensive developer tooling
   - *Mitigation Approach:* For each feature, implement the simplest version that validates the core architecture

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a tactical roadmap for building Strella incrementally, while validating core assumptions early. By focusing on foundational elements first and taking a vertical slice approach, we can build confidence in the architecture while showing visible progress throughout development.

The later phases (e.g., Phase 4, 5) are currently defined at a higher level. As the project progresses and learnings emerge from earlier phases, these later phases will be broken down into more granular milestones and tasks.

The plan should be treated as a living document and updated as learnings from each phase inform subsequent work.
